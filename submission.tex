The preferred format is MS Word (.doc and .docx documents). See the \fntbf{Style Sheet} (downloadable at http://www.eaco.eu) for further information.\\[4mm]
\fntbf{Submit} the manuscript online (www.eaco.eu/submit) or via e-mail (danube@eaco.eu). Sending a manuscript indicates a tacit understanding that it is not actively under consideration for publication with other journals.\\[4mm]
\fntbf{Double blind review}

The \fntit{DANUBE} is a peer-reviewed journal. All the manuscripts fulfilling the requirements mentioned above undergo a double blind review process provided by the members of the Editorial Board and two anonymous external reviewers. The double blind process means that neither the author knows the reviewer's identity nor the reviewer knows the name of the author or other reviewer.\\[4mm]
The manuscript is accepted, accepted conditionally or rejected on the basis of the reviewers' suggestions. If accepted conditionally, the author is supposed to correct it while taking the remarks of the reviewers into account and the reviewers are entitled to ask for re-evaluation of the paper. The final decision is made by the Editor-in-Chief. Finally, accepted manuscripts are edited in accordance with the practices of the \fntit{DANUBE} which include the language editing and proofreading.
